# This script was used to shuffle the Swamp Stars using a random seed from Chainlink VRF.
#
# The purpose this scheme was so that no one, especially us, can know what Swamp Stars
# they would get before the VRF returns the seed, giving everyone a fair shot at minting.
#
# Anyone can verify that the Swamp Stars were ordered according to this scheme by getting
# the random seed we used from the contract with the function getRandomIndex() and then
# running it through the same functions used in this script. There is no way to change
# the random index after it has been set.

# We're using a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm with the random seed from Chainlink VRF.
# In simple terms, it takes a random item from a list and swaps it with the last item
# in the list that hasn't already been swapped. It repeats this swapping action until 
# it has iterated over every item in the list.
# For more details https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherâ€“Yates_shuffle
#
# The one big difference from a normal implementation of this algorithm is the reuse
# of the previous random number to generate the next, the purpose of which is to make
# the outcome deterministic and replicable but still unpredictable until we have the seed.

        # generate pseudorandom numbers since it will be the easiest to prove for the user in the future.
